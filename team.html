    <p>
      I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast and junior penetration tester with practical experience in ethical hacking, vulnerability assessment, and web application security. My journey spans multiple technology fields—from web development and software testing to networking, systems, and cloud security—giving me a broad understanding of how to build, break, and secure digital environments.

      I have hands-on experience identifying and ethically exploiting web app vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection (SQLi), Remote Code Execution (RCE), and more. Using tools like Burp Suite, Wireshark, Metasploit, Nmap, Nessus, and others, I perform thorough assessments to uncover hidden weaknesses and strengthen defenses.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've completed certification-based courses in introductory cybersecurity from IBM and Cisco, and I hold Code the Future badges for HTML & CSS. My drive is fueled by a strong passion to understand how systems work and to teach others how to secure them.

      My mission is to make cybersecurity learning hands-on, engaging, and accessible to anyone willing to learn. Whether you're just starting out or looking to level up, Bsecurity is here to guide your journey.

      This platform is not just about education — it's about empowerment. Through my blog, free courses, and premium ethical hacking training, I aim to help others transform curiosity into real-world skills.
